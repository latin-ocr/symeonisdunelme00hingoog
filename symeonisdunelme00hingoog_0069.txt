the first volume of Symeon’s works, leaving the Hwtory of tlte
Clurcl os Durlom as material for a second.

The Editor agreed, at the request of the Council, 10 under-
take the supervision of the first volume only, but he truste ere
long to see the second also eompleted under an editor more
conversant than himself with tasks of 11110 nature.

He was only induced 10 incur the responsibility to this
extent by the kind offer of the Rev. James Raine, the able
and indefatigablc Secretary of the Soeiety, to relieve him
altogether from the task of collating MSS, and to assist him
in the correction of the prese.

The task of collation, which was expected to be chiefly
confined to the Cambridge MSS, has been much more onerous.
As regards the werke in the former edition, asecond MS. of
the tract on the archbishops of York required attention, whilst
the discovery of another and most important MS. of the ffa-
torr'u dc Sancto Cuthberto is due 10 Μ1. Raine’s research.

The additional matter which has been inserted involved

ι greatly increased labonr, a large share of which devolved upon
the same kind friend.

Seven 01 the MSS. of the Translatioae os St. Cutlrbert,
several of them containing also the Relatio, anda mass of
extrancous matter, have been examined and collatcd by him 3
also the MSS. of the Life of St. Margaret, and the abridg·
ment 011110 same, both 01 which required peculiar attention,
in consequence of the injurios which they had sustained from
fire.

He also made a very minute collation of the Liber de
Adventu Soranum, 10 the Library 01 Magdalen Collega, Oxford,
with the transcript which l had obtained from the British
Museum. All this involved repeated journeys to London,
Orford, and Cambridge.

Ι am also indebted 10 Mr. Raine for 1110 references which
appear in the 00100 1101 only 10 1110 endless quotations from the
lloly Scriptures, but to verses taken from Boethius, Sedulius,
and Aldhelm, as well as to the writings of Baronius relative to
couneils and other ecclesiastical matters.
