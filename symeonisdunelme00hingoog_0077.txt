Malmesbury‚ are in various hands. The poem of Beda is full of
interlineatious, other words being inserted with the word 001
before them. The word vel occurs in other places throughout the
first part of the MS, showing that it was regarded as subject to
correction. There arc also many interpolatione (given between
the lines), uot noticed as such in the printed tert, which have
evidently been donc hya north country hand. Iregard the
greater part of this as Symeon's own notes aud extraets, out of
which the chronicle from 848 downwards was constructed and
perhaps designed to bc extended upwards. The scribe found
them with the complcted portion (i. e. from 848downwa1ds),
and copied the whole. Ile has shewn his estimate of Part
No. 2, by copying it carefully and neatly. The First Part he
has treated as a set of Notcs‚ as he found it. Evcn the chrono-
logical part is carelessly written, and he has probably added
largcly to the whole, intending perhaps to make something
orderly of it. He probably inserted the accounts of Acca
and Alehmuud, and secured copies of the Passion of Ethel-
bert, etc.

The {decapitulatio begins 10818 (Twysden, ool. 137), with a
carefully made letter in green and red, evidently intended to
mark the commencemeut of a work. It is carefully and neatly
written throughout in the same set and orderly hand which
wrote foll. 37-52, and which goes on afterwards. In this part
there arc occasional erasures, and words put between the lines,
or in the margin, or at the foot of the page.

Of these the greater number, especially the marginal re·
ferences rclating to northern bishops and persons, are in aeoarse
hand, which appear in other parts of the MS, i. e. in Part No. l,
John of llerham, and the account of St. Mary's abbey, and
especially iu Nennius. The referenceS, etes, to the archbishops
of York, the bishops of Hermam, Chester and Lindisfarne, are
all of them in this hand. The erasures relate generally to
northern matters. The writing is probably very early thirteenth
century, if not somcwhat earlier. The remaindcr of the mar·
ginal references arc hy the scribe himself, and are in a small
nent hand.
