' decease 01 Ranulph Archbishop 01 Canterbury,‘ which occurred

in 1122. The first four chapters arc derived from the History
01 St. cuthbert, and are all of them adopted or referred to by
Symeon. The first contains the rision of King Alfred; the
second the miracle 01 the three bloody waves; the third the
legendos Onalafball, or, as his name is herc spelt, Onalafbald ς
the fourth is the history of the destruction of the Scottish host
iu the reign 01 Guthred. To all these Symeon, doubtless, had
acccss in the pagos of the earlier authority ; but the fifth and
sirth are not to be found there, but first occur in the present
work. The fifth chapter recorda the punishment 01 Barcwith
or Barcwid, a soldier 01 Earl Tosti, for a violation of the sanc·
tity 01 the monastic precincts, to which 'Symeon specially refers,
as it is “ elsewhere detailed more fully.’'¹‘ The sixth chapter
contains arelation, adopted by Symeon, 01 the miraculous·
interposition, by which the monks werc enablcd to pass the
nands between the mainland of Northumbcrland and the island
of Lindisfarne at high tidc, when they fied with the body 01 the
Saint to escape thc anger of William the Conqueror after the
slaughter of Robert Cumin and his men at Dnrham! The
sevcnth chapter, which forms chapter xviii. of the work as it
now stands, is the most interesting of the whole, containing a
minute aud circumstantia] account of the exhumation 01 the
body 01 St. Cuthbcrt,1.n. 1104. This is found in all existing
MSS. 01 the Translations 01 St. Cuthbcrt, to which indeed it
gives name, the bulk of the remainder of thc work being taken
up with a serica 01 miracles, which although due to the inter-
position 01 the Saint, are only occasionally connected with the
migrations of his remains. It is printed separately in the Acta
Sanctorum, and a translation is given by the late Dr. Raine in
his St. Cuthbcrt, pp. 75-78.

The eleven intervening chapters, vii. to xvii. inclusive, occur
in all the MSS. with the exception noted abovc3 chapters xix.

and xx. are in the Laud, Arundel, and Gale MSS, xxi. in -
Arundel and Gale only.
