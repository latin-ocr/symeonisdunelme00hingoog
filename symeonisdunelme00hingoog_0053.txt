down. We are thus enabled to determine its date to within a
year. Stephon, we are told, continued to hold the earldom of
Northumberland in his own hands, as his predecessore Willinm
II. and chry had donc before him. This could not have been
written later than 101139, 10 which year the earldom was
onec more severed from the erowu of England, and conferred
on Henry, son of David, king of Scotland: neither could it
bave been written earlier than the previous year, 1138, in which
Geoffrey Rufus, who occurs as bishop of Durham‚ was appointed
to that 000.

The only additional particulare supplied by this MS. relate
to Robert de Mowbray‚ carl of Northumberland, wb0, in oppo-
sitiou to other authorities, is said to have ended his life in tha
monastery of St. Albam, to which be had been a munificent
benefactor. From this intimation we may conjecture that this
transcript was mado either 01 Tynemouth‚ a cell 01 St. Albana
founded by this earl Robert‚ or at the parcnt establishment.

'l'bat the monks of St. Albans were in possession of a copy
is unquentionable, as it has been used extensis-'ely by historiens
connected with their house. The series 01 1110 earlier kings 01
the heptarehy, as given by Wallingford, is copied verbatim from
this sources and many subsequent notices are derived from it.
Several remarkable instances will also bc pointed out 01 the
obligations of Roger de Wendovcr, who stands at 1110 bead of
the great ebroniclers 01 st. Albane, to this work.

1110 arrangement to the end 01 1110 fourth section is the
001110 as in MS. Caligula, but no rubries are prefixed to the
accounts of the kings of Kent and llast Anglia. The later
sections follow iu the following order :—

5. Arebbishops of Cantcrbury and York.

7. Kings of Ilssex.

is pointed out in 1110110100 00 regards each state.
