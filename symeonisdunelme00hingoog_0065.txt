this name ; but here again adifficulty arises from the lowness
ef his position en the rell, where he stands the hundred aud thirty·
first in order. If the transcriber ef the MS. had no better
ground than the occurrence ef the initial T. in Theoderie fer
selecting him as the author, there are no less than five other

meuks whose names equally satisfy this condition, and who
precede Theoderie in the date of their profession. Turkil
stands eighth, just two below Turget, and Thurstan severity-
aixth, being thirty-eight below Symeon. There are two ef the
name ef Thomas who stand eighty-third aud eighty-sixth, aud
another called Tureld, eighty-uinth. Eveu the last of these,
although apparently too lew ou the rell, stands earlier by sorty-

authority of the MS. supporta them, are inferior to all. If

taken, and a new edition of this tract has long been a deside-
ratum.

of the fisthc are from the Life ef Quaen Margaret, printed above,
which is there referred to as “The Legeud ef the Life ef the

from the Geneolepy ef the Kiups ef Euplond by Aelred of Rie- '
vaulx, as will be seen by a reference te the notes. The part
which is unaccounted for is probably taken from some other
work ef the same author, whose writiugs arc very numerous,
