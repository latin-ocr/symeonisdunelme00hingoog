In aecuraoy it is perhaps superior to ull the rest, and the text
of the tractate De lhomlotionilmr ia mainly derived from it.

Besides these, the following MSS. have been examined :-

6. MS. Bodl., Digby 59, agrees substantially with MS.
Laud, 491, but the chapters are somewhat differently arranged,
the fourth chapter being placed before the first. It contains
twenty chapters in all, after which are several chapters from
Symeon. Ι1 is in small octavo, written cirea 1200, and contains
Sir Kenelm Digby's autograph, “ Vindice te tibi; Ken. Dipbyf’

7. MS. Fairfax, 6: foli0, double columns, a large and fine
MS, containing all the Durham Historiam, in a hand 01
the fifteenth century. At the beginning is this line with the
Christian name 01 the transcriber,

“Nomen scriptoris est Petrus plenus amoris.”

lt contains the two chapters from Beda, with twenty of the
Translations as iu Laud.

8. MS. Cotton, Titus A. ii, a fine old book of the fourteenth
century from the Durham Scriptorium, affords no additional
matter.

9. MS. Dec. et Capit. Ebor, xvi, i., 12, a well-known
volume which has been much used by the Surtees Society. It
isos the fourteenth century, and contains chapters xviii. 10 xxi.
inclusive.

10. MS. B0dl., 514, a thin quarto in the old sheepslrin bind-
ing, written eirca1200, has belonged to the abbey 01 J ervaux in
Yorkshire, and bears the inscription “Liber Sancte Mariae de
Jorevolle;’' also the name of the grantee of the abbey lands,
“ Arthur Darcy.’' It contains only a fragment 01 the Translu-
tione, three or four pages 01 chapter xviii.

All the above MSS, with the exception 01 No. 9, are notieed
by Mr. Hardy. There is also a copy of the twenty chapters of
the T renotatione without any distinetive title, with numerous
other miracles from Beda, Symeon, and other known sources, in
the “Lawson M S, the property of Sir John Lawson of Brough,
Bart.'’ A minute description of the volume, by Μ1. LongStaffe,
will be found in the Archaeologia AEliana, vol. ii. , parti, octavo
