name contrastcd with other ancient authorities, in note y,

From Ethelfrith to Ceolwulf, Beda and the ancient North-
umhrian chronology appended to his works are the authorities
followed. The ancient annals which are incorporated in the
Historia Regem Anylorum are then taken up, and form the
basis of the narrative, not merely to the period where they
abruptly cease in the Hastorio Regum sn. 802, but astar as
they are used by Symeon in the Historia Dunetmensis to the
reign of Ricsig an. 873-6. The length of this king’s reign,
which is not given in that work, is herc stated to have been
three years, which is also the term assigned to him in thc
second part of the Historia Bepara. There is an apparent dis·
crepancy between the two authorities as to the reign of his
successor, Egbert 11, who is here said to have reigned two
years,t i. a, to the year 878. In the second part of the Historia
Regum he is spoken of as if he were still alive on the accession
of Guthred to the throne of the southern province, as there
stated, nn. 883. The words are, Regnavit (Guthredna) super
Eboracum ,· Eybert vero saper Northimbros. The sense, how-
ever, in which they were intended to be used might merely be,
Guthred had the seat of his government at York, (whereas)
Egbcrt only reigned over the Nerthumbrians (beyond the
Tync). Our authority, again, gives to Guthred a reign ot'
fourteen years, whereas the Historia Reyam places his death
sn. 8943 bnt Ethelwerd, a much earlier and better authority,
mentions his death and burial at York two years later, nn. 896,
which would be in the fourteenth year of his reign, or, if we
compute it from the death of his predecessor, Halfdene, we
have fourteen years complete. The following table of North·
umbrian chronology, from the slaughter of the two kings,
Osbert and Ella, an. 867, to the death of Guthred, is com·
piled from the several works in this volume, with the abore
correction from Ethelwerd :-

‘Thia statement is copied in the little Nerthumbrian chronicis printed
amongst thc Excerpta Historia ct topographia in the Appendir, p. 219,1. 30.
