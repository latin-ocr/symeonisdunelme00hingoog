note, in reference to the claime of Monkton :-“ Erat autem
territorii Gyrwcnsis haud grandi oriundus viculo. Non longe
inde lapsurus in oceanum —- amnis Tine praeterfluit.'' The
date of the historian's birth is given as 677.

Treet No. 5, Beda's Lives of the Abbats. See above.

No. 6, p. 235. A MS. of Nennius. See Rudd, who
ascribes it to the commencemcnt of the twelftb centiny, vide
Hardy's Catalogue, i.‚ 325. Itis Stevenson’s N., and Pctrie’s
C. ; Hardy gives it to cent. 12, Stevenson to cent. 13. My
examination not relating to it specially, I speak with deferenoe,
but to my eye it scemed earlier than the documento of the time
of bisbop Pudsey, to which my attention was directed.

Notwithstanding Stevcnson’s note, xxviii, the MS. requires
carosnl collation. It has nottho genealogies, and, in some
respects‚ may not bc of a high ordcr3 but its northern cha-
racter deserves attention. It has the miracles.

ln Arthur’s battlcs the MS. reads Glem, or Glein: Duglas:

Bassas: Callidonis: Gninon: Ribroit.

nt the end os Stevenson'S, h 56, the MS. proceeds thus :-

“ Usque ad tempus quo Ida regnavit, qni fuit filius Eobba,
ipse primus [fuit rcx added ia a baad contemporary, or nearly
so]. Prima civitas Britanniae ipsa ia Bcoraicaoi‘ est quae

vocatur Cair Gaorthiyira.” Thea the remaining twenty-five
cities arc enumerated thus :—

Cair Muncip, Cair Meiguod, Cair Ebroauc, Cair Ceretano,
Cair Mouchguid, Cair Caint, Cair Peris, Cair legion, Cair
Legeint, Cair Gnent, Cair Lerion, Cair Pensa vel Coit, Cair
Guinhng, Cair Lnelid, Cair Colum, Cair Cnsteint, Cair Greuth,
Cair Lunden‚ Cair Guoricon, Cair Legion Guar iunc, Cair Brito,
Cair Drotchoi, Cair Urnach, Cair Celeimon, Cair Lnit Coit.

Thon comes what stands in Stevenson as the preceding
sentence, “ Haec sunt nomina‚'’ etc.

⁶ This mark σι refers to a separate clip bound into the MS. ot mnoh the
semediata, beginning “Ida filins Eobba tenuit regiones, eto.. areem,” ota, as in
Stevenson's note 14, on his p. 52. After all, whether the copyist did not
thoroughly misunderstand his original, and whether “in Beornieo'' does not
properly belong to the ‘⁶ snit rex ’⁹ os his interlincation.
