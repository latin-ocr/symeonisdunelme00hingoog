XX PREFACE.

erroneously dated by Malmesbury. Swebrcht also, king of the “
East Saxons, whose death is recorded an. 738, is noticed by
no other author. Again, in 740, we read, “Arwine‚ theson
of Eadulf‚ was elain.” Eadnlf was one of the petty kings who
ruled in separate districts of Kent at that period, unnoticed by
historiens, bnt known to ns hya charter bearing his name in
the Textus Roffensis. The Nerthumherland Annals appended
to Beda mention his death, without noticing his parentage3‘
by no other historian is any mention made of him. Under the '
year 749 the following statement occurs in our text, which is
not to be met with elsewhere: “AElfwald, king of the East
Angles, died. Hunbeanna⁶ and Alberht dirided his kingdom
between thcm.”

As regards the Fasti of the English Church wc have much
exclusive information. We find the succession of the bishops
of Lindsea‚⁶ and the names of many bishops of the Mercian
sees ,l notices of the consecration of two bishops of Selsea,‘
and of one of each of the dioceses of Hercford‚ Sherbum, and
Elmham ;f of the deaths of two bishops of Londona and oue
of Rochester,l all unnoticed by thc Saron Chronicle, in common
with which we have also lists of the archbishops of 'Canterbury

and York, and of the bishops of Lindisfarne‚ Hexham, and
Whitheme.

¹ “Aruuini et Radbertus interlecti.’' We have no clue to the identity ol*
Radbertus, ir indeed the reading is correct.
