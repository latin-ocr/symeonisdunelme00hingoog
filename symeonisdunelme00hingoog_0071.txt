lxvi sansacu.

Catalognc of the Materiale for British History‚ by his friend
aud coadjutor Mr. Duffus Hardy, the present chief of the
Record establishmcnt. of the value of the latter I have
already adduced a striking instance. Of the former I will only
say that, irrespective of the erudition which is so eminently
displayed in the preface and notes, Ι have in numerous cases
derived assistance and information from a glauce at the lucid
and comprehensive Iader Rerum, which Ι could only have
obtained otherwise by a toilsomc search through many volumes.

It will be observcd that Ι have invariably spelt the name oi
my author Symeon, instead of Simeon, the orthography adopted
by Twysden ou the authority of tho Cambridge MS. In this Ι
am supported by the list of monks in the autograph copy of
the History of the Church of Durham‚ and by the spelling of
the name in the Liber Vitae, and the ancient Obituary of that
church. The same orthography also prevails in Reginald's
Miracles of St. cuthbert, and in the Cotton MS. of the Arch-
bishops of York, and is adopted by Leland.
