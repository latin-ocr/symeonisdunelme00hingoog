lviii rauraca.

and has this rubric, “Incipit Translatio et Vita Sancta Marga-
retae reginae Scottorum.” Itis printed in the Aeto Sanctorum,
and again by Pinkerton in his lives of the Seottish Saints. An
abridgment exista in the MS. Cotton, 'liberius E. i., a folio in
double columns, also injured by lire. It extends only to four
and a half peges, and is of the beginning of the fourteenth
century. At the foot of the pages is a pedigree of the deseend-
ants of king Malcolm.

This abridgment has been printed by Capgrave with the
addition of a section from Aelred of Rievaulx, and has been re·
printed by Surius. Pinkerton’s collection contains the abridg-
ment, as well as the more extended biography. Both works
have been carefully collated with the MSS. by Mr. Raine for the
present edition; all variatione between the original and the
abridgment are pointed out; and those passages which have
been rendered illegible by the fire have been supplied from
Pinkerton. These are distinguished by brackets, the portions
between which represent the amount of injury sustained.

The writer, inhia dedication to Matilda, queen of England,
the daughter of Queen Margaret, gives only the initial letter of
his name, describing himself as “Tss servus servorum S. Cuth-
berti,'’ from which we gather that he was at the time of writing
it a monk of Durham. He writes in a great measure from his
own knowledge, and details the particulare of an interview with
the queen not long before her death. lhom an expression
which she uses in addressing him, “ llgo posthac in hac vita diu
non subsistam: ta autem noa paveo post me tempore vives,'' it is
probable that the author was not then an old man. He was
not present at her death, but gives an account of it from the
narration of the priest who attended her, and who afterwards
became, like himself, amonk of Durham. Fordun twice quotes
the ¹work as the production of Turget,¹⁰ and it is probably on his
authority that Capgrave in his edition of the abridgment re·
presents the conversation referred to above, as having taken
place between the queen and Turget, whom he describes as her
