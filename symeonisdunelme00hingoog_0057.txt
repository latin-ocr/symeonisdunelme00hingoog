twenty-six, but thirty-six years. He then tells ns that Regnold
reigned ten years, and his brother Sihtrie a sero years, after
whom came his son Guthferth, who was expelled by Athelstan
an. 926. This chronology is framcd on the assumption that
Rcrrnold succceded immediately on the death of Eowils aad
Ilalfdcnc, placing the termination of his reign an. 921, and
allowing fii'e years for the reigns of Sihtrie and Guthferth.
But Regnold was engaged in Ireland long after 911,’Ι and hia
connection with Nortlmmbcrland commenccd with the iucur-
sion in which he besieged and took York, which is tired by
the Saron Chronicle an. 923, by the Historia Rapum 919]
In 924 he made submission to Edward the Elder‚ and the
following year he was expelled. The Saron Chroniele allows
only one year for the reign of Sihtrie, placing his death in
926, and thc expulsion of (1 uthferth in 927. Itis remarkable
that the Liber de Adventu Samonion makes uo mention of
Regnold at all, nor does it from this period furnish us with a
single name or an incident of Northnmbriau history down to

the expulsion of Eirie, the last king of that pmiince, with ·
which we are not acquaintcd from other sources. The Historia
meeum, on the other haud, whilst following for the most part
the authority of the Saron Chroniele, gives important details
from sorno independent authority? probably, as has been
suggested, from a continuation of those annals on which the
earlier portion of it is altogether based.l

l ln 915 Regnold aad Sihtrie lauded in Ireland; one at Kildara, the other
at Waterford. From this time they appear from the Irish Annals to have
exere-ised a joint authority until an. 918, when their brother Guthferth, or
Godtrcy, rande himself master ef Dublin‚ and assumed the chief command,
which he retained till his death an. 932.

t 'Phe latter was probably tho true date, as the events ot Begmold’s reign, aa
recorded in tho Historia cuthberti, the Historia Regum, the l‘ietish Chronicle,
and other authorities, would scarcely have been compressati withina periodos
two years.
